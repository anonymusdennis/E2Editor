# E2Editor
An editor for the escapists

the te2 Mapeditor mod dev here: yes i am still working on the mod 
(Currently I am adding Keybinds and tools for testing the maps although I will definetly not add these "Tools" into anything other than the map tester...)
Currently Working While in The Map Test Menu: 
- Wallclip (walk through everything)
- Immortality....
- noWanted...
-Infinite Energy
-infinite Money
-StopDogs (dogs stop hunting you)
Broken:
- floor up 
- floor down 

--> I am now going to work on fixing bugs and Including the Building Blocks of the Dlc Packs And all the other integrated Maps 
WARNING This might take some time to do because I will need to sieve through alot of Gamefiles 
If anyone Is Interested In helping with the Development Or has requests I should add / remove just PM me 

Thanks for all the positive feedback ðŸ™‚ 
happy Escaping 
And I repeat I do not want to ruin the gaming experience so I am worried that the workshop gets flooded with broken maps.. 
This means that I will likely not remove the map-completion checks (some limits such as the amount of officers inmates etc will still be as high as possible...)
All the cheats wont work while playing normal... Only in the Editor Test Playthrough they are enabled
I am too thinking about adding the ability to edit existing maps from the workshop but what do you think (some might steal and reupload good maps)...
